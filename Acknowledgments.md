# Acknowledgments

I would like to start by thanking all the mentors I have had throughout my career, including my current advisor **Amit Tandon**, my previous advisor **Ilson Silveira**, and who collaborated with my research and have given me letters of recommendation for this program (**Simon de Szoeke** and **Amala Mahadevan**). I came from a place with few opportunities and both my parents (**Sandra** and **Vicente**) and my academic mentors believed and invested a lot of time to get me to where I am now. Since I started my undergraduate degree in Oceanography at the Federal University of Ceará in northeastern Brazil, I have always greatly admired and wanted to participate in this program, despite finding it practically unattainable for someone with my background. I was in disbelief when I received the approval email and perhaps out of impostor syndrome, it took me a while to understand that the selection committee and the directors believed in my potential.

The program directors, **Colm** and **Stefan**, with such different personalities, were always very welcoming and were always very concerned about how I was handling the program.

I would like to thank **Keaton Burns** very much for being so patient and mentoring me so closely throughout the process of developing this project. I learned a lot from his mentorship and I am very grateful that he trusted and invested in my work. I felt lucky to have been mentored by someone so skillful, pedagogical and patient.

I would also like to thank **André Souza** for always being so open to my questions about this new world that the GFD introduced me to.
As Supercloud computing resources were crucial to the development of this work, I could not leave **Chris Hill** out of this statement. He was essential in enabling us to run so many complex numerical experiments in such a short time.

I would especially like to thank **Peter Schimd** and **Laure Zanna** for being inspiring teachers, making such complex subjects seem simple, and for always being so open to discuss and answer our questions. Laure also mentored me on this project and I loved all the conversations we had about science and career. **Pedram Hassanzadeh** helped me a lot to understand the language and application of different artificial intelligence algorithms and without him, I would not have been able to understand some of the applications this work may have in the future.

I would also like to thank **all the speakers** who took the time to present their work to us and then talk to us about various topics.
Likewise, I would like to give a special thanks to those who were there all summer. **Glenn** for being our oracle, **Pascale** and **Carl** for asking the best questions, **Neil** for showing that science can also be fun and **Joe** for his dynamics insights.

I also dedicate this paper to all the Fellows this year. **Sam**, **Rui**, **Kasturi**, **Tilly**, **Ruth**, **Claire** and **Ludovido** each showed me their perspective on the world and science. I was very happy to have had such a diverse, collaborative, friendly and non-competitive group. You all made this whole experience shareable.

I would like to thank my friend **Nikiforos** very much. In between the comings and goings, he was my road companion and helped me keep my head while I was completely overwhelmed with so much daily information.

I would like to thank **Julie Hildebrandt** and **Janet Fields** for all their support in the admission and administration. As I would also like to thank the janitor **Rich** who came by late at night every day to clean the cottage, remind me that I needed to come home and sleep, and have friendly conversations about random subjects.

I also dedicate this work to my great friends who encouraged me and helped me from the beginning to the end: **Cesar Rocha**, **André Schmidt**, **Filipe Pereira**, **Igor Uchôa**, **Bruno Gonçalves**, **Jeane Rodrigues**, **Letícia Lima**, **Christian Buckingham**, **Elizabeth and the Ells family**, and **Siddhant Kerhalkar**.


Finally I would like to thank my beloved wife **Ágata** for supporting me so much and giving me so much comfort so that I could feel at home even if I was far away. You are the best companion.
