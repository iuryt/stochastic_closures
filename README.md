# Stochasticity of Turbulence Closures

This is a repository for the code from my [WHOI GFD summer school](https://gfd.whoi.edu/) project.
The main scientific questions explored are:
 - How different are subgrid stresses from different nearby turbulent solutions? 
 - How fast do nearby coarse-grained solutions diverge?
 - How quickly does the subgrid stresses decorrelate compared to the LES timestep?
